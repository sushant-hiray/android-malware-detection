##Decompressing an apk file

The bash script `decompress.sh` can be use to decompress an apk file to its code contents.
The script is made as a part of an ongoing RnD project!

###Usage

    ./decompress.sh -d <path to apk file>

###Dependencies

* Java Jdk
* dex2jar <http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/>
* jd-gui viewer <http://jd.benow.ca/>

###Note: 
Edit the `DEXPATH`variable accordingly with the path to dex2jar folder.

Sometimes the `jdgui` viewer doesn't render files correctly when opened from commandline, so opening them manually works currently.
